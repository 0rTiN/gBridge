**gBridge allows you to control (almost) any smart home device, any smart home software, with Google Assistant. Therefore, it transforms actions received from Google by voice commands to MQTT messages.** Since MQTT is an open, commonly used, widely available and well documented protocol, you can integrate Google Assistant easily.
