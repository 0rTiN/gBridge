## Kickstarter
Currently, a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1720541463/gbridgeio-control-anything-with-voice-commands) is running for this project. The funds will be used to ensure future development of gBridge, to improve its user interface and especially to implement support for Amazon Alexa devices! Let's have a look at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1720541463/gbridgeio-control-anything-with-voice-commands) and consider becoming a backer!

## About gBridge.io

**gBridge.io allows you to control (almost) any smart home device, any smart home software, with Google Assistant. Therefore, it transforms actions received from Google by voice commands to MQTT messages.** Since MQTT is an open, commonly used, widely available and well documented protocol, you can integrate Google Assistant easily.
